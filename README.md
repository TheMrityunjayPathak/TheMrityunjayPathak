## About

<div>

<p>Hi üëã, I'm Mrityunjay Pathak
 
I am a dedicated Data Scientist with a knack for uncovering patterns and trends that drive smarter decisions.

üéØ Tools and Technologies

‚Ä¢ Programming : I'm skilled in using Python, a powerful language for data science and data analysis.

‚Ä¢ Libraries : I'm familiar with essential libraries like NumPy (for numerical operations), Pandas (for data manipulation), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizing data) and Plotly(for interactive visualization).

‚Ä¢ Machine Learning : I'm familiar in various machine learning techniques like Regression (predicting values), Classification (sorting data into categories), Clustering (grouping similar data), Dimensionality Reduction (simplifying complex data) and Model Selection (choosing the right predictive model).

‚Ä¢ Database : I can work with MySQL, a popular database system to handle and retrieve data effectively.

‚Ä¢ Version Control : I'm familiar with Git, which helps in keeping track of changes in code and collaborating effectively with a team.

‚Ä¢ Web Application : I have experience working with Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

‚Ä¢ Web Development : I also have some knowledge in web development, specifically HTML and CSS.

## Experience

Data Science Intern <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Iap8SWdYVMMSbNyqpZpMBA3mWuzNFlE/view?usp=sharing">@Unified Mentor</a>
<p>Duration : August 2024 - September 2024 | Type : Remote</p>
<p>As a Data Science Intern at Unified Mentor, I worked on 2 impactful projects :

‚Ä¢ [Netflix Data Analysis](https://github.com/TheMrityunjayPathak/Netflix-Data-Analysis) : To gain insights into the content available on Netflix, understanding the patterns and trends to uncover valuable insights into how the platform curates and evolves its offerings.

‚Ä¢ [Supermarket Sales Analysis](https://github.com/TheMrityunjayPathak/Supermarket-Sales-Analysis) : To gain insights into Supermarket Sales Performance understanding the patterns and trends in customer behavior, product categories and regional sales.

These projects allowed me to apply my skills and gain practical experience in fundamental areas of data science such as data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization.</p>

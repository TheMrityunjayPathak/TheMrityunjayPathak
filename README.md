## About

<div>

<p>Hi 👋, I'm Mrityunjay Pathak
 
I am a dedicated Data Scientist with a knack for uncovering patterns and trends that drive smarter decisions.

🎯 Tools and Technologies

• Programming : I'm skilled in using Python, a powerful language for data science and data analysis.

• Libraries : I'm familiar with essential libraries like NumPy (for numerical operations), Pandas (for data manipulation) and Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizing data).

• Machine Learning : I'm familiar in various machine learning techniques like Regression (predicting values), Classification (sorting data into categories), Clustering (grouping similar data), Dimensionality Reduction (simplifying complex data) and Model Selection (choosing the right predictive model).

• Database : I can work with MySQL, a popular database system to handle and retrieve data effectively.

• BI Tool : I'm proficient in using Microsoft Power BI, a tool that helps in turning data into actionable insights through interactive visualizations.

• Version Control : I'm familiar with Git, which helps in keeping track of changes in code and collaborating effectively with a team.

• Web Application : I have experience working with Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

• Web Development : I also have some knowledge in web development, specifically HTML and CSS.
